Temperature Analysis:
    ✔ Daily Averages: Calculate the average temperature for each day. @done(23-12-24 00:13)
    ✔ Temperature Range: Identify the highest and lowest temperatures during the forecast period. @done(23-12-24 00:13)
    ☐ Trend Analysis: Check for temperature trends over the forecast days.

Humidity Analysis:
    ☐ Relative Humidity Trends: Look for patterns or trends in relative humidity.
    ☐ Comfort Levels: Assess whether humidity levels are within a comfortable range for humans.
    ☐ Correlation with Other Parameters: Explore if humidity correlates with temperature or precipitation.

Wind Speed Analysis:
    ☐ Peak Wind Speeds: Identify the highest wind speeds during the forecast period.
    ☐ Wind Direction: Analyze the predominant wind direction.
    ☐ Wind Speed Distribution: Create a histogram showing the distribution of wind speeds.

Precipitation Probability Analysis:
    ☐ Daily Precipitation Probability: Summarize the probability of precipitation for each day.
    ☐ Rainfall Amount: If available, analyze the expected amount of rainfall.
    ☐ Correlation with Temperature: Check if precipitation is correlated with temperature changes.

Cloud Cover Analysis:
    ☐ Daily Cloud Cover Percentage: Summarize the cloud cover percentage for each day.
    ☐ Sky Conditions: Categorize sky conditions (clear, partly cloudy, cloudy).
    ☐ Impact on Temperature: Explore how cloud cover influences temperature variations.

Overall Forecast Analysis:
    ☐ Composite Graphs: Create composite graphs showing multiple parameters on the same chart for easier comparison.
    ☐ Weather Events: Identify any specific weather events (e.g., storms, temperature spikes) during the forecast period.
    ☐ User-Defined Thresholds: Highlight conditions that exceed user-defined thresholds (e.g., extreme temperatures, high wind speeds).

User Interaction:
    ☐ Allow users to customize analysis parameters: Let users choose specific date ranges or parameters for analysis.
    ☐ Provide Insights: Summarize key findings or insights from the data.
    ☐ Visualizations: Use graphs, charts, or maps to visually represent the data for better comprehension.

Machine Learning (Optional):
    ☐ Implement machine learning algorithms to predict future weather conditions based on historical data.
    ☐ Explore clustering techniques to identify patterns in the data.
